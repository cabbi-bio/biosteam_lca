The integration of other animal species groups (e.g. insects, birds, mammals, amphibians) with their specific habitat preferences could change the characterization factors. We recommend utilizing the developed characterization factors for land use in Central Europe. In order to assess the impacts of land use in other regions it would be necessary to sample empirical data on species diversity and to develop region specific characterization factors on a worldwide basis, because species diversity and the impact of land use on it can very much differ from region to region.
